Demand Forecasting for Stores

# Project Overview
This project aims to forecast demand for retail stores. Accurate demand forecasting is critical for optimizing inventory management and improving sales. In this project, data analysis and a forecasting model were developed to predict demand based on historical data.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The project utilizes data from a file named `train.csv`.
- **Features**: The dataset contains weekly sales data for each store, along with time series information.

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and processing
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms


### Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps include handling missing data, splitting weekly data into day, month, and year components, among other preprocessing tasks.
- **Forecasting Model**: Several machine learning algorithms were used to develop a demand forecasting model.

### Results
At the conclusion of the project, the forecasting model was evaluated based on defined success criteria. The model achieved an accuracy level suitable for practical demand forecasting.
